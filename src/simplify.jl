# simplify.jl - simplify numeric expressions in Julia.
# 
# Common examples of expressions that may be simplified are multiplication
# by 1 or fully numeric expressions that may be just calculated out.
# 
# Simplification is performed by rewriting original expression according to
# a list of simplification rules defined using macro `@simple_rule`.
# This macro as well as function `simplify` are exposed to the outer world.

# TODO: check if it's possible to add new simplification rules from
# outside the module

"""
Macro to add simplification rules. Example:

    @simple_rule (-x * -y) (x * y)

where `(-x * -y)` is a pattern to match expression and `(x * y)` is what
it should be transformed to (see `rewrite()` to understand expression rewriting).
Symbols $SIMPLE_PHS may be used as placeholders when defining new rules, all
other symbols will be taken literally.
